Hello! Here is a fast guide on how to install my modded version of FallenOS! (Don't forget that the credits go to AnbyFox!!!! :))
Before you can download my modified version of the mod, you must have the original FallenOS mod, which you can find here(1.0.1): https://gamebanana.com/mods/438001

After you made sure that you have the mod, all you have to do is to download the "icons", "menuBGS" and "logo.png" files and replace them in the "images" file in your mod (assets > images).
My version of these files replaces your intro, logo, menu, freeplay and results background and some icons.

!IMPORTANT NOTE! You must have the Menus Style set to "FallenCity" in order to work!! (options > game settings > hud customization > menus style)

If you want a custom song in the mod, download the "music" file and replace the "music" file in your mod (assets > music).
It replaces the song from the "FallenCity" Menus Style. (It won't work if you don't have the "Recreates OS" Menu Theme activated!!).
(The song is "Don't do it" by yvncc.)

This is it! Have fun with my modded version of FallenOS!! :D
