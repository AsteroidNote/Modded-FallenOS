# Hello! Here is a fast guide on how to install my modded version of FallenOS! (Don't forget that the credits go to AnbyFox!!!! :))
## Before you can download my modified version of the mod, you must have the original FallenOS mod, which you can find here(1.0.1): https://gamebanana.com/mods/438001

### After you made sure that you have the mod, all you have to do is to download the "icons", "menuBGS", "logo.png" and "glitch.png" files and replace them in the "images" file in your mod (assets > images).
#### My version of these files replaces your intro, logo, menu, freeplay and results background, some icons and the glitch screen (death, pause and glitch screens).

## !IMPORTANT NOTE!
### You must have the Menus Style set to "FallenCity" in order to work!! (options > game settings > hud customization > menus style)

##
### To get the custom notes, all you have to do is to download the "circle" file and replace it in the "images" file in your mod from the "shared" file (assets > shared > images).
#### The file replaces the "circle" notes. (It won't work if you don't use the "Circle" notes!)

## 
### If you want a custom song in the mod, download the "music" file and replace the "music" file in your mod (assets > music).
#### It replaces the "Recreated OS" song. (It won't work if you don't have the "Recreated OS" Menu Theme activated!!)
#### (The song is "Don't do it" by yvncc.)

## This is it! Have fun with my modded version of FallenOS!! :D
