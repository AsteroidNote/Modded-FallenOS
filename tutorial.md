# Hello! Here is a fast guide on how to install my modded version of FallenOS! (Don't forget that the credits go to AnbyFox!!!! :))
## Before you can download my modified version of the mod, you must have the original FallenOS mod, which you can find here(1.0.1): https://gamebanana.com/mods/438001

## You can follow the steps written underneath or just download here: https://github.com/AsteroidNote/Modded-FallenOS/releases/tag/v0.0.1

## Custom Backgrounds, Logo, Icons and Glitch Screens!
### After you made sure that you have the mod, all you have to do is to download the "icons", "menuBGS", "logo.png" and "glitch.png" files and replace them in the "images" file in your mod (assets > images). My version of these files replaces your intro, logo, menu, freeplay and results background, some icons and the glitch screen (death, pause and glitch screens).
### !IMPORTANT NOTE! You must have the Menus Style set to "FallenCity" in order to work!! (options > game settings > hud customization > menus style)

## Custom Animated Backgrounds with effects for Uncontrolled Reaction and Pr0cess1ng_An0maly

### To get it, download the "hazard-week" folder and replace it in assets > shared > images. Download the "hazardous-zone.lua" file and replace it in assets > stages.

## Custom Animated Backgrounds for all songs except QT songs and Redacted and Custom effects for Inhuman Songs (eyes, warning outlines and pincers)

### To get it, download the "yama-alley.json" and "yama-alley.lua" files and replace them in assets > stages. Then download the "data" folder and replace it in assets. For the effects, download the "inhumanPack" and replace it in assets > shared > images.

## Custom Command Prompt!
### To get my custom command prompt, you have to download the "hazard" file and replace it in the "images" file in your mod (assets > images).My version of this file will replace all your command prompts from the mod with a darker version.

## Custom Notes!
### To get the custom notes, all you have to do is to download the "circle" file and replace it in the "images" file in your mod from the "shared" file (assets > shared > images). The file replaces the "circle" notes. (It won't work if you don't use the "Circle" notes!)

## Custom Song!
### If you want a custom song in the mod, download the "music" file and replace the "music" file in your mod (assets > music). It replaces the "Recreated OS" song. (It won't work if you don't have the "Recreated OS" Menu Theme activated!!) (The song is "Don't do it" by yvncc.)

# This is it! Have fun with my modded version of FallenOS!! :D
